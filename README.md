ml-service 🤖

Mentora's ML microservice — a Flask REST API serving a scikit-learn career prediction model, deployed independently from the main Next.js app.

Part of the Mentora platform.

📌 What It Does This service exposes a REST endpoint that the Mentora frontend calls to generate ML-based career insights for users — such as salary predictions, role-fit scores, or skill gap analysis — based on a trained scikit-learn model. Separating this into its own service means:

The model can be retrained and redeployed without touching the main app Python ML ecosystem (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy) stays isolated from the Node.js frontend The service can be scaled independently if inference becomes a bottleneck

🚀 Getting Started Prerequisites

Python 3.10+ pip

Clone the repo bashgit clone https://github.com/ishanikapoor197/ml-service.git cd ml-service
Create a virtual environment bashpython -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # Mac/Linux venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
Install dependencies bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Train the model (if no pre-trained model exists) bashpython train_model.py This will read from data/, train the model, and save the serialized output to model/.
Run the development server bashpython app.py The service will be available at http://localhost:5000.
📡 API Reference POST /predict Returns a career prediction or insight score for the given user profile. Request body: json{ "industry": "Software Engineering", "experience_years": 3, "skills": ["Python", "React", "SQL"], "education": "Bachelor's" } Response: json{ "predicted_salary": 95000, "role_fit_score": 0.82, "top_skill_gaps": ["System Design", "Cloud Infrastructure"] }

⚠️ The exact fields depend on your trained model. Update this section to match your actual request/response schema.

GET /health Simple health check — returns 200 OK if the service is running. json{ "status": "ok" }

🧠 Model Details

Algorithm: (e.g., Random Forest / Gradient Boosting — update with your actual model) Training data: Located in data/ — tabular career dataset Serialization: Model saved with joblib to model/model.pkl Retraining: Run python train_model.py to retrain from scratch

🌍 Deployment The service is deployed on Render (or Heroku — as specified by runtime.txt). Deploy to Render

Create a new Web Service on render.com Connect this GitHub repo Set:

Build command: pip install -r requirements.txt Start command: gunicorn app:app

Add any required environment variables in Render's dashboard Deploy!

Environment Variables env# Add any secrets your app.py uses, for example: FLASK_ENV=production

Any API keys or config values
🔗 Integration with Mentora In the main Mentora Next.js app, set this environment variable: envML_SERVICE_URL=https://your-ml-service.onrender.com The Next.js API routes will call ML_SERVICE_URL/predict when generating career insights for users.

📝 Notes

Make sure pycache/ is in your .gitignore — it shouldn't be committed The model/ directory contains the trained .pkl file — commit it if it's small enough, otherwise use Git LFS or regenerate on deploy via train_model.py
